	<p> 
		My name is Albert Tseng. I am a sophomore at Tufts University studying Computer Science with a minor in <br>
		Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies. I was born in Mountain View, California and later moved to San Jose, <br>
		California where I lived for 18 years before moving out the Massachusetts for college. Growing up, I was <br>
		always super interested into athletics. In middle school, I was the captain of my school basketball team <br>
		for two years and led them to two different conference championships. In high school, I was a two time <br>
		All-American in swimming, breaking two high school records that withstood for 30+ years. Senior year of <br>
		high school, we placed 4th overall in the California Central Section and 7th in California for the 200 <br>
		freestyle relay, which was ranked the 27th fastest time in the nation for high school swimming. Many <br>
		different colleges offered my spots on their team, but I ended up choosing Tufts University for its <br>
		laid back, but still competitive environment. I ended up quitting the swim team the end of my freshman <br>
		year in college. <br>
